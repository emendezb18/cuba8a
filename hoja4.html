        <h4 class="parrafo">The Sierra Maestra National Park is a rich natural paradise. Due to its beauty and excellent ecological circumstances, which support a large number of rare fauna and flora species, you may find on its terrain a huge landscape and climate variability. The Cuban people today respect this place highly due to its natural worth and historical significance.</h4>
        <h4 class="parrafo">Jack Nicholson, Prince Albert of Monaco, and Sting are just a few of the famous people that have eaten here. This restaurant, which has been operating for 75 years and is still regularly filled, is considred the grandfather of all Havana's restaurants . Even without the famous meals, such as papaya lasagne, suckling pig, or chocolate fondant, a trip there is worth it because of the city views alone.</h4>
